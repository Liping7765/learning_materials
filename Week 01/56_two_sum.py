"""
review session:

Q1: for sorted list, which method is better?
Ans: Two pointers 
Q2: if we need to return index instead, which method is better?
Ans: Hash table is better, given it uses time O(n) and space(n) 
Reason: we need to generate extra space of O(n) to store the original index of the array, because after being sorted, the postion will be changed.
